# My HTML Learning

This is my spot to play around with HTML!  Here you'll find all the practice files I made while learning how to build websites.  Think of them like building blocks  â€“ stuff like text, pictures, and links that make websites work.

Feel free to look at my files, change them around to see what happens, and even build your own! This is a place to have fun and learn new things.

Some awesome websites that helped me on my HTML journey, check them out if you want!
